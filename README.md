# Scrolls End

Metroidvania style platformer demo. Only contains 1 partial level with bits of story and maybe 2 or 3 encounters.

## Quest

You start at a relatively friendly castle. You've climbed into the hills and are only a few steps away from the entrance. You're looking for someone who has been taken prisoner at this castle.

You read a sign at the entrance about the castle. Proceed.

As you cross the bridge to the castle, you find a special item at the entrance. Going forward you encounter a garrison guard who's permission you need to go deeper into the castle. You can opt to leave or fight. If you win the fight, he'll call for mercy and tell you to go up to the walls for what you seek. 

However, you'll find that you can't reach the top because you need double jump. You proceed a level below to explore.

Below you'll find the jailer who also will not let you proceed without permission. However, he's crooked -- if you can pay him off or resolve a task for him, he'll give you access to a secret room which has the jump power up. The task will send you further below the castle.

At the final lowest floor you find another special item which will give you access to the secret room (completing the request). Once you have double jump, you can now go to the roof if you want. 

Or you can continue through the castle to the other side, where the General awaits. She knows you dont have permission to be there so you have to fight her.

If you win, you'll gain a key and a new weapon. The key can be used to unlock the elevator to re-enter the castle, where the initial guard will be waiting for you. Talking to him will release your friend. 

The end!
